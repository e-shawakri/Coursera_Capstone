    "The datasets used in this project are collected from one main source namely, Wikipedia. Please refer to the Data Description section for more information about the data.\n",
    "The Foursquare data, will be added within the notebook and no external file will be created for it. The API calls will be made within the code cell. Once the necessary data is collected, cleaning the data is done.__\n",
    "\n",
    "__Step 2: Cleaning Data\n",
    "This step consumes a lot of time. The cleaning of data in this project is done for the Toronto Datasets by deleting Nan values for Borough feature, merging the similar postal codes and if there is any NaN vlaues in the neighboorhood feature we make it similiat to Borough feature. Check the data section for the notebook for scrraping and cleaning.__\n",
    "\n",
    "__Step 3: Visualization\n",
    "A few simple visualizations are made in order to get a better understanding of the data. _Folium_ is used for this purpose. Folium generates interactive and beautiful maps, using the Latitude and Longitude we provide. \n",
    "Further to enhance the understanding of the data, count plots are used to better understand the final result.__\n",
    "\n",
    "__Step 4: Machine Learning\n",
    "_KMeans_ clustering algorithm is used on the most common venues dataframe to identify the probable clusters for different types of restaurants. In both the datasets, we have initialized 5 clusters.__\n",
